             We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by lifeâ€”daily and hourly. Our question must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
